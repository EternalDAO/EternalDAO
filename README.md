Dao is eternal.

Nameless, formless, speechless,

It is the ultimate principle that flows

Across space-time.

The Dao existed before the Heavens,

Before the formation of the stars,

Before the firmament and the Earth,

And the genesis of Man.

Boundless, the Dao goes on and on,

Pervading all the myriad things.

It is the great unity

Of the infinite and the infinitesimal.
